                <p>"Hello! My name is Elizabeth Bennet, and I live in Longbourne along with my parents and 5 sisters:
                    Jane, Mary, Catherine, and Lydia. At a ball hosted by Mr. Bingley, a man named Fitzwilliam Darcy
                    refused to dance with me, which was mildly offending. To my surprise, that spring, he proposed to
                    me! I couldn't believe that this seemingly obnoxious and arrogant person wanted to marry me, so I
                    immediately refused and insulted him, which now seems unnecessary. Meanwhile, my younger sister
                    Lydia fled with an officer named George Wickham and Mr. Bingley proposed to my older sister Jane.
                    After the eventful few days, Darcy proposed to me, and this time, I accepted. I am looking forward
                    to having a peaceful but adventurous life with my new husband" - Elizabeth Bennet
